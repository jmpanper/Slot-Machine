Slot Machine
============

This slot machine has been developed for training purposes only. I do not support gambling in any way, nor do I encourage gambling. If you do gamble though be sure to win or play safe.

The project currently has one main script, where all the logic of the Slot machine is coded. This is a simple Slot Machine executed in terminal that uses a set of possible characters as symbols, generating the winning patterns using random values and picking  the character's values out of a set.

Future Changes:
- Making it more visual
